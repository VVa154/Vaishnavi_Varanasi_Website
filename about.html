        <h1>My Story</h1>
        <p> From a young age, I have always been driven by curiosity. I did not just memorize facts, I questioned why things worked the way they did. This curiosity naturally drew me toward Math and Physics and shaped the way I approach learning and problem-solving.</p>
        <p>As I grew, I became fascinated by the power of data. Working with real-time data in labs inspired me to analyze it, explore patterns, and extract meaningful insights. This passion led me to pursue an MBA in Data Science and Analytics. During this time, Statistics became my thing. I loved uncovering patterns, building models, and using numbers to tell meaningful stories. It was also when I discovered a love for coding, solving complex problems, and finding practical ways to create business value.</p>

<p>After graduating, I joined a top company as a data scientist. Here, I got to apply what I had learned, turning raw data into actionable insights that made a real impact. My journey did not stop there. I pursued a Masterâ€™s in Business Analytics in the US, where I deepened my knowledge in AI and Machine Learning while focusing on deriving tangible business outcomes from every project.</p>

<p>Through every step of my journey, one principle has guided me: <strong>embrace change</strong> , <strong>keep evolving</strong>, <strong>aim for excellence</strong>, and <strong>always strive to deliver the best version of yourself in every task</strong>. This philosophy has shaped my path and continues to drive me forward every day.</p>
